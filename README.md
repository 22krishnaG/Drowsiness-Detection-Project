Drowsiness Detection using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to detect drowsiness in real-time using machine learning techniques. Drowsiness detection is crucial for ensuring the safety of drivers, operators of heavy machinery, and individuals in various contexts where alertness is critical. By monitoring facial features and eye movements, this system can alert individuals when signs of drowsiness are detected, potentially preventing accidents and improving overall safety.

Features
Real-time drowsiness detection using computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
Utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, for accurate and efficient detection of facial landmarks and eye movements.
Integration with webcam or video feed for live monitoring.
Customizable alert system to notify users when drowsiness is detected, such as sound alerts or visual indicators.
Option for data logging and analysis to track drowsiness patterns over time.
Easy-to-use interface for configuring detection settings and viewing real-time monitoring results.
